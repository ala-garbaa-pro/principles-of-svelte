# Motion and Transitions Q&A

Does anyone have any questions about transitions? I've noticed you've developed a three.js wrapper for Svelte. My question is, where do you draw the line for the need to use a third-party library for animations? Obviously, in three.js, it's for 3D animations, but in a scenario like wanting to use GSAP, does Svelte provide all the required APIs for animations that GSAP can, or what are the limitations of animations generated by Svelte?

That's a good question. Svelte doesn't have a lot of built-in animation features. If you're dealing with a complex sequence of animations, transitions might not be the ideal tool in that situation. You could use GSAP or any other animation library.

Controlling when elements are unmounted from the DOM is challenging with an external library. Knowing when an element is being removed is crucial for transitioning it out gracefully. Transitions provide built-in support for this concept, allowing state transitions to happen over time, which a third-party library might not seamlessly hook into.

If you're changing the opacity of an element without removing it from the DOM, third-party animation libraries can be used, especially for complex animations. Thrill, a community-driven project I use, is a special case. In Thrill, you deal with three.js objects, and Svelte can't easily control how those elements are removed, making you dependent on third-party libraries.

I hope that answers the question. Now, you're talking about the merits of CSS versus declaring animations in JavaScript, perhaps by adding your own classes and manipulating them with Svelte. What are your thoughts on that?

It depends on what you're doing. While declaring animations through classes and manipulating them with Svelte is an option, it can be challenging to coordinate activities when removing elements from the DOM or unmounting components. This is where transitions become handy.

Regarding a comment I received: I wanted to use Svelte transitions but apply them when the element was hidden and unhidden in CSS, not removed or added to the DOM. I wanted everything in the DOM but just hidden.

Transitions are designed for that scenario. In such cases, you may need to use CSS classes.

It's an interesting use case. I wonder if there's a way to add the ability to control CSS animations added with a class through Svelte. Perhaps we'll consider adding a new feature; feel free to open an issue on GitHub.
